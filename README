# listToLight.js

listToLight is a super simple lightbox script.

Most lightbox scripts require you to add classes (or other attributes) to the images that you want to be lightboxified.

This is fine, most of the time. But sometimes, you don't want to do this. If you're using Jekyll, for example, adding classes means using HTML. This is a pain - it's nicer just to use markdown syntax.

With listToLight, any images in lists will be 'lightboxified'. This means that the list will turn into a scrollable slideshow, activated by clicking on an image. The original list will also have a class added, so that you can style the images appropriately (eg turning them into thumbnails).

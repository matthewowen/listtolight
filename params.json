But sometimes, you don't want to do this. If you're using Jekyll, for example, adding classes means using HTML. This is a pain - it's nicer just to use Markdown syntax.\r\n\r\nWith listToLight, any images in lists will be 'lightboxified'. This means that the list will turn into a scrollable slideshow, activated by clicking on an image. The original list will also have a class added, so that you can style the inline images appropriately (eg turning them into thumbnails).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nInclude the 'ltl' directory in your static tree. Include the files comme Ã§a:\r\n\r\n    <link href=\"/path/to/js/ltl/ltl.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" media=\"screen\" type=\"text/css\">\r\n    <script src=\"/path/to/js/ltl/ltl.min.js\"></script>\r\n    \r\nUse the following to lightboxify all images in lists:\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function () {\r\n        'use strict';\r\n       listToLight();\r\n    });\r\n\r\nUse the following to lightboxify only images in lists within containers with class 'foo':\r\n\r\n    $(document).ready(function () {\r\n        'use strict';\r\n       listToLight('.foo');\r\n    });\r\n\r\n## What it doesn't do.\r\n\r\nYour thumbnails are just going to be your regular images, only scaled down. This isn't ideal, but in this day and age of high quality images, this isn't that big a deal. And it means no waiting to load when people do click to increase the size.\r\n\r\n## An example\r\n\r\n* ![Kitten](http://placekitten.com/400/400)\r\n* ![Kitten](http://placekitten.com/300/300)\r\n* ![Kitten](http://placekitten.com/500/300)\r\n* ![Kitten](http://placekitten.com/400/500)","name":"listToLight","google":"","tagline":"Easy lightbox slideshows with a minimum of markup and classes"}
